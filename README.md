# Advent of Code

## What is this about?

From the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) website:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

The fun thing about these challenges are, there is no *right* way on how to solve these! This means AoC are more than just puzzles; they are also opportunities for the participants to try out new skills (and using them to solve them).

I also have a fair share amount of skills I want to try out, and AoC is the perfect mean for me to do so. Below are my solutions to AoC puzzles, *in various ways*!
